                                    Although I didn't listen to the album in it's entirety, it was
                                    a dissapointment. After the rap group's recent work Culture I, 
                                    I learned that the Migos have a very specific and generic style that
                                    they don't stray away from. Quavo and Offset, two of the group's members, 
                                    released collaborative projects with other artist's where they were forced
                                    to adopt new styles. Those projects were successful because of the unique stylistic
                                    adjustements the artists made to fit their project. This album feels as though 
                                    they were more comfortable than innovative. This project definitely has a few strong 
                                    tracks but it's nothing we haven't heard before.

                                    This show is honestly really funny. I've never seen it before
                                    but it just happened to be on tv. Usually I'll just jump on netflix and 
                                    turn The Office on but I'm at my uncles house and I figured I'd take
                                    advantage of his huge tv and watch cable for once. Ever since streaming sites
                                    like netflix and hulu have become prominent, cable has lost it's beauty and
                                    is no longer a part of my life. That last sentence was oddly formatted but it's okay
                                    because I'm not an english major.

                                                        I've never been a really big comic guy because I never knew where to start
                                                        but superhero movies have always been my favorite. Marvel has been killing
                                                        the game and these Avenger movies have given me life these past few years.
                                                        I never really knew about Black Panther or his character till the most recent Avengers
                                                        movie but he was without a doubt, a baller. I can't wait to see his movie. I highly doubt
                                                        Marvel will dissapoint because to my knowledge, Thor has been their weakest set of movies
                                                        yet, and I still really like them. I don't know, all I'm saying is, opening night, I'm going to have a

                                            "Albert?" She asks, and unseeing eyes wander over to the doorway. I tell her yes. 
                                            The nurses tell me that it's better if I go along with it. It's better to make her happy 
                                            than confuse and scare her with the truth. I go to her, I put flowers in the vase, I ask 
                                            her about her day. She rambles, a little incoherently, about something that happened ten years
                                            ago. I smile and nod. She suddenly tells me that she wants to read my palm, and I give her my 
                                            hand. I realize my mistake only afterwards. She stops, stiffens. A look of pure fury plays over 
                                            her face. I try to ask her what's wrong and she starts screaming. She stands up, wobbling and 
                                            keeling dangerously, and starts throwing things at me. Books, mostly, but a snowglobe hits the
                                            corner of her dresser and shatters. I'm not wearing the ring. Why am I not wearing the ring? Am 
                                            I cheating on her? Do I not love her anymore? She's sobbing and I can't move. I don't know what to 
                                            do. A nurse runs in and pulls me away, out of the room. A couple more attendants go into her room 
                                            to calm her down. I sit down on a bench in the hallway and try to tell the nurse that this is wrong, 
                                            I want to tell her the truth. The nurse just shakes her head and leaves me alone. I know she's right. 
                                            The last three times now have ended in tears, because she can remember the husband who died ten years ago 
                                            well enough to recognize every mistake I make but she can't remember that she has a grandson. I'm the only 
                                            one who even bothers to visit anymore. After ten minutes of sitting on the bench I realize I left my phone in 
                                            the room. I walk up to the door and open it hesitantly, afraid that she's still mad. I open my mouth to apologize. 
                                            She turns towards me with a vacant, glassy stare and slight frown. I want to throw up. She was the smartest 
                                            person in my life for 20 years. I visit her every day. "Albert?" She asks.
