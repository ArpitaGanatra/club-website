# club-website
The official remodeling of the official club website. The current website hosted on Github pages is in depserate need of a facelift.
Ideally, we want our Website to be a central place for
 - Potential Club members who are interested in what the Open Source Club is and want to find out more
 - Existing Club members as a way to easily check what events are happening and what projects the club is working on   
 - Students or others who are interested in UF or Open Source in general and want to see how UF is involved with Open Source

## Built With

- **HTML**- (Short for Hypertext-Markup Language. Everything you type is essentially the barebones of the website)
- Imagine a website with no color, no styles, and no custom positioning of elements. That's basically a normal HTML file and would look something like this:

- **CSS**- (What makes a Webpage look the way it does and what you will be working on for about 70-80% of a standard webpage development)  
- With CSS imported into your HTML file, it makes the pervious website look like this:

- **Javascript**-(A language that allows us to manipulate webpages in special ways. More on this later...)
