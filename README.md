# UF Open Source Club's Website

The official remodeling of the official club website.

The website needs to be a central place for
 - Potential club members who are interested in what the Open Source Club is and want to find out more
 - Existing club members as a way to easily check what events are happening and what projects the club is working on
 - Students or others who are interested in open source in general and want to see how UF is involved with Open Source
