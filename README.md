# UF Open Source Club's Website

The official remodeling of the official club website.

The website needs to be a central place for
 - Potential club members who are interested in what the Open Source Club is and want to find out more
 - Existing club members as a way to easily check what events are happening and what projects the club is working on
 - Students or others who are interested in open source in general and want to see how UF is involved with Open Source

## Getting Started

Install
- An internet browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
- A text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	- Install an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin if available, to help ensure consistent formatting

[Then clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

### Testing

Open up the index.html file (under the website folder) in a browser by dragging the file from your file explorer into the browser window.

## Deployment

TBD, probably deploying our own Nginx server.
